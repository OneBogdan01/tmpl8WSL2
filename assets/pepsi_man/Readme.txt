SUPER MALE
----------
	SuperMale is a plug-in player model for iD software's Quake 2.  Modelled by 
myself (Paolo) with additional v1.0 skins contributed by DaLinK, Wizz[IQ], Golden Eagle,
Alex Lazara, James Costa, Dennis Farrell, and DoubleD.  The 42 skins for the pack were 
chosen by Paolo with input from DaLinK.


USAGE
-----
	Unzip the contents of SuperMale.zip into the folder baseq2/players/SuperMale/
under your root Quake directory.


MAKING YOUR OWN SUPER-HERO SKINS
--------------------------------
	Included in this release are MuscleBase.jpg, WireBase.pcx and Example.pcx.  These 
files are included so that you can easily create skins for your favorite superhero.  
I have tried to arrange the skin mapping such that rectangle selecions and hue changes
should suffice for creating most superhero skins (this is exemplified in Example.pcx).
I suggest you start with MuscleBase.jpg, and use WireBase.pcx as a guide to selecting
the parts of the skin to modify.
	If you think you have created a quality skin, you can send it to me for possible
inclusion in the next release of SuperMale (email: ppiselli@edlab.cs.umass.edu).  The 
best skin for each superhero will be included with each release, so feel free to rework
one of your own skins, or try to best someone else's

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
----------------	
	I have to thank Gwot and Rouge13 for answering my novice questions with care.
I must also thank those who made the Quake2 Modeller, NPherno's Skin Tool, and the
Skinview MOD, these are all great tools which every Q2 modeller should try.  Finally, I
have to thank all those skinners out there who spend their free time cooking up new 
clothes for SuperMale.
